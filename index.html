                The field of Computer Science has generated millions of jobs since the dawn of the first hello world program.
                Now, with a field of jobs blooming you'd think that there would be enough people to fill all of those positions right?
                The issue with the Computer Science field, at least in America, is that there is a deficit of skilled professionals.

                Thousands of schools across the nation have degree plans for Computer Science, and many obtain their degrees.
                Of those thousands of students more than 75% of them walk into their new jobs a few days, maybe even hours, after graduation.
                If you study Computer Science at Oklahoma Christian you will guarantee yourself in a position at one of many companies that seek out OC students in particular, such as Tinker Air Force Base and Paycom.
