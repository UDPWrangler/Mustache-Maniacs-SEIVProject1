                With the world in "times of uncertainty", we see that more and more of our world is becoming connected to the global network and even automated to make our lives easier.
                The Burea of Labor Statistics projected that over the course of the next 8 years, there will be an increase of at least 45 thousand jobs in computer occupations. 
                This means that there will be a gap in the market and a needs for Computer scientists to fill these gaps.
